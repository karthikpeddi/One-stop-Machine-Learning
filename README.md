# One-Stop ML Website
This project is a Flask based Web Application which gathers all the Data Science Algorithms in one website. All the algorithms were implemented from bottom up to achieve very high training and testing accuracy in python and many insights and visual representations are generated based on the algorithm type like Adjusted Rand Score, Accuracy, Normalized Mutual Index, Confusion Matrix Heat Map, Box plots of the Numerical Variables, Scatter plot of the clusters, WCSS vs k Line plots, Accuracy vs k plots, Decision Tree using gini index, Count plot of categorical Variables, Precision , Recall and other metrics.
